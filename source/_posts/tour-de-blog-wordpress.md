This week's stop on the Tour de Blog is [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com), a free blogging service that also offers "completely" optional paid upgrades.

Setting up a blog on WordPress was easily enough, but there doesn't seem to be a way to edit the theme directly. There is a CSS editor, and an impressive set of Sidebar Widgets, but no obvious capability for rolling your own. There is a Custom CSS upgrade, but that's style code only no HTML or JavaScript.

WordPress offers a rich editor and maintains the code in HTML. My initial first impressive is "pretty and featurefull, but sluggish".

At the end of the series, I'll provide a roundup with more indepth remarks, but I'd like to give several systems a try before comment on more than the initial impression.

To access the blog system of the week, follow the [http://husted.com/ted/blog/index.html](http://husted.com/ted/blog/index.html) link. Feel free to re-up for the feed, so as to give each system a fair test. Of course, if anyone has a preference or other feedback, feel free to comment.
