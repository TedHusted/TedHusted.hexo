Over the years, Struts has gone from zero Checkstyle errors to over twenty thousand. I'd like to try and slim that down to around ten thousand by using automatic reformatting tools like Jalopy and IDEA. I tried it with the Action subproject, but there was some [pushback](http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@struts.apache.org/msg17321.html). I need to check to see if everyone is on board before proceeding one way or the other.
