Leverage your hard-earned Struts experience in this five-day hands-on course, developed and delivered by Ted Husted. Learn how to intergrate existing Struts applications with the Next Big Thing: Struts Action Framework 2\. The course covers migrating existing applications to Struts Action 2, with a focus on upgrading the most important asset of all: the grey matter between your ears.

Along with migration issues, the course covers advanced development topics, such as creating a data access layer, securing web applications, and creating tag-based user interface components.

This five-day course is being held in Rochester NY, August 14-18\. Class size is limited. [Register early to reserve your place.](http://www.strutsmentor.com/register.html)
