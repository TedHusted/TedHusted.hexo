Phil Zoio has released Strecks 1.0.1 with some small updates to the 1.0 release.
> "The main change in this release is it now much simpler to run the samples: simply download the source distrubution, then run "ant download run.samples".
> 
> "Strecks contains a range of enhancements aimed to streamline the Struts 1.x programming model using Java 5 language features. These enhancements include annotations for validation, data binding, type conversion and dependency injection, as well as a range of other features including pure POJO actions, interceptors and Spring integration."
