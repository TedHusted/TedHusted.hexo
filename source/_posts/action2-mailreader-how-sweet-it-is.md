There's a rough edge or two yet to file, but the
[Action2 MailReader is up and running](http://planetstruts.org/action2-mailreader/), along with it's [very own tour](http://planetstruts.org/action2-mailreader/Tour.do), and I'm ready to call it "code complete". ([And here's the code.](http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/struts/sandbox/trunk/action2/apps/mailreader/src/))

I can't say I very much enjoyed writing yet-another MailReader tour (this makes three), but it was a useful exersice. To do the tour, I had to review the code again, and I found better ways to do some things in the process.

In porting both the MailReader and tour, I become more and more convinced that WebWork **is** Struts, only better. It's everything we ever wanted in a 2.0 release, and more. As my new friend Claus Ibsen says, "I have the sweet eyes for WebWork."
