I finished the first draft white paper on the [Agitator software](http://www.agitar.com/) last week. The Agitator is a pleasure to use, and I might start using it with the Struts framnework code this week. We have a significant patch to apply to 1.2.x, so I'd like do an Agitator test to prove that we need the patch and then to show us it's been fixed. Agitar has given me licenses to share with any Struts Committers who might want to create and run the tests.
