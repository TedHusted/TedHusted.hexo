People often comment on the number of Java web development frameworks. The Evolutionary Goo blog has an excellent summary of [Java web framework taxonomies](http://evolutionarygoo.com/blog/?p=94).

Now, can someone do the same for Ajax libraries? I've heard tell that there are about 200 Ajax libraries in use today -- which puts the Java framework community to shame, especially when we've had a five-year head start. :)
