While products like SalesForce and iMIS Public Views provide great functionality out of the box, there are a number ofÂ  PV customizations that NimbleUser customers often request.

* **Calendar Location Maps with Get Directions.** By tieing in with Google Maps, we can extend the standard iMIS calendar to provide a location map, and then pop-off to Google Maps for directions. A great, low-cost way to enhance the standard iMIS event calendar.

* **Custom Members Directory.** The standard iMIS Public View Directory pulls from the members database, and it's easy to configure, but PV Directories comes with several constraints. Everything has to fit on one row, there's no detail view, and it's public. With a custom directory, we can add a detail page, link email or website addresses, restrict access, and more.

* **Member Join.** With standard Public Views, people can create free web accounts. We can extend the join process to include paying members, and collect whatever additional demographics your organization needs.

* **Join during event registration.** Often, member pricing for an event is a great inducement to join some organizations. We can make applying for membership a seamless extension to event registration, so that your newest members can join without a second thought.

* **Bypass email confirmation during account create.** The standard account create process includes an email confirmation step that confuses many new users and generates support calls. With a simple change, we can bypass the email confirmation, to reduce support costs and increase user satisfaction.

* **Support duplicate email address.** Out of the box, Public Views has trouble coping with members who share an email address, especially when a password needs to be reset. We can extend the base workflow so that members can share email addresses, without resetting each other's password.

* **Ajax login notification for event registration.** When accessing an event, the standard iMIS login prompt is buried on the screen and often missed. With our Ajax notification solution, it becomes easy for users to login and complete registration, without confusion or support calls.

* **Limited number of complementary sponsor registrations.** If your organization offers sponsors a set number of complementary registrations, we can extend Public Views to cap the number of free registrations per sponsor.

* **Readonly profile fields.** If there are some profile fields that members should see but not touch, we can make selected fields read-only.

* **Extend profile with custom pages.** iMIS has great demographics, but sometimes an organization needs a more comprehensive profile. We can extend the profile with custom pages, to make it easier for members to maintain their own configuration.

* **Downloadable documents **(after purchase). In this virtual world, many digital publications have value to your members. With Download Documents, users can purchase the right to a copy of a document, spreadsheet, PDF, presentation, or image, and then download it from a personal portal page.

* **Flexible payments.** We also have solutions for discount coupons and installment dues, to provide members more flexibility.

We often integate iMIS with Ektron websites, which creates some other great opportunities.

* **Ektron/iMIS provider.** Our Ektron SSO solution authenticates web site users against iMIS and lets us create web site authentication groups based on iMIS critera.

* **Community Workgroups** with your choice of Calendar, Forum, and/or Documents pages. Most organizations have working groups that need to collaborate. By combining Ektron communities with iMIS demographics, we can automate the creation and maintenance of collaborative groups, with access to their own Calendar, Forum, and Document library.

* **Dues Alerts at Login.** Keeping up with dues is an easy thing for members to let slip. With a Dues Alerts, we post a dynamic reminder on the website that displays when members log in and have outstanding dues.

* **Ektron Blog Aggregator.** If you'd like to post blogs on your website, but don't have the internal staff to keep it up, consider gathering together (or aggregating) your member blogs. Other members can visit your site, take in all the summaries of peer blogs at a glance, and click through to view the detail on the original site. An aggregator is a great way to build synergy between your member's and your organization's web sites.

* **MyPage. **With the Ektron/iMIS provider, we can create individual profile pages that combine the best of iMIS demographics and Ektron social media controls. Members can choose among a selection of widgets to create their own custom dashboard.

* **Conference Page.** We have several approaches to creating microsites around your organizations conference, increasing usability and reducing maintenance.

* **Multiple Location Maps.** If your organization has several locations, we can help you create a map of all your offices and allow users to drill down on any location for more detail and directions.

* **Flush web cache** to show latest updates. High performance site are often aggressively cached. We can provide a simple for flushing the cache on demand, so that your members get the latest updates as soon as they are redy.

Even if we haven't done your customization -- yet -- be sure to give us a call, and we can discuss doing iMIS or Ektron ***your*** way.
