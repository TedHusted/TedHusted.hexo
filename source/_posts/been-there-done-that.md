So, how many times have you said to yourself: "Ummm, we had that problem before ... and what did we do?"

If you're like me, wayyyy to many times![

Lately, I've started to keep a "Common Problems" page on the project's wiki to log incidental problems and quick-fixes. [There's an example at the Anvil site. ](http://code.google.com/p/anvil/wiki/CommonProblems)

Simple. Effective. Easy to do. (So, just do it!)

If nothing else, after spending an hour banging your head against a simple problem, you'll have something to show for it :)
