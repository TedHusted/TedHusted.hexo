My friend and fellow Struts Committer Ian Roughly has brought out the first Struts 2 book, which is available both as a PDF and as a conventional printed book. Kudos, Ian, kudos!

"[Starting with Struts2](http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/starting-struts2)" is aimed at those who are new to Strut2, and those familiar with MVC frameworks but unfamiliar with Struts2\. It provides everything you need to know to get up and running using Struts2, and can be used as a starting point to explore the more intricate features of the Struts2 framework. Topics include architecture and configuration, how to implementing actions, and supporting infrastructure such as validation and internationalization. Also included are productivity tips, providing a practical introduction on how best to use the framework.

Right now, I'm working against a hard June 30 deadline, but I made time to at least skim the PDF. The book looks great. At 122 pages, it's a small book that doesn't try to replicate the online Struts 2 documentation. Instead, the book is a perfect complement to the Struts 2 website. It fills in the gaps and should make it much easier for web developers to "hit the ground running" with Struts 2.

You can bet that I'll be ordering a printed copy to add to my collection of Struts books. It's an incomplete collection: I only have twelve. But I'm very glad to make Ian's book lucky #13.

In other Struts 2 news, my compadre Don Brown is busily preparing a release of Struts 2.0.8\. The beat goes on ...
