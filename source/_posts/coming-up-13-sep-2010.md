Here's a run down of three events coming up soon.

<span style="font-size:large;">Rochester Java Users Group, Tue 14 Sep </span>

A career focused meeting with a panel of three recruiters discussing how the job market has changed. People go about searching for new opportunities in a different way, hiring companies look for new talent differently, and the recruiter's role has changed as well - compared to the 80-ies/90-ies way of browsing the local newspaper and sending letters.

This is an opportunity to update yourself on how the (job) world now works, to participate in an interactive evening featuring open discussion between developers and the panelists. The panelists are David Calus of E-R Associates, David Sable of TEKSystems and Eric Derby, The Software Scout.

Meetings start at 6:00 pm and end around 8:00 pm, and take place on the Second floor of the Golisano building, at RIT, room GOL-2400\. Directions to RIT can be found at [www.rjug.org](http://www.rjug.org/)
