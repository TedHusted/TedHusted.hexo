I have a few days off from the Oklahoma DEQ project while we sort out some paperwork. [Agitar Software](http://www.agitar.com/) asked me to review their Agitator testing tool some time ago, and I finally have some time to try it out. Nice folks. Slick product. Agitar has a stealth open source initiative. Like Atlassian and JetBrains, Agitar will assign complementary licenses to active, verifiable open source projects, like Apache Struts. I'm trying it on the MailReader now. If people like the idea, we could check the tests in the repository and continue to use the Agitator to test Struts applications and even the framework itself.
