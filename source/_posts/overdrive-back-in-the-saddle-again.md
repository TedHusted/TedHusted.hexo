After a ten-week hiatus, I'm finally back to work on my ASP.NET project with the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality. We spent the week picking up where we left off. Our applications are based on the Nexus framework in the Struts sandbox, so you can expect to see new activity there now. Maybe one day, we can attract a community and bring OverDrive out of the sandbox!
