The Confluence wiki has been a great way to compose the documentation for WebWork 2, but it doesn't always do a good job of revealing just how much documentation there really is (e.g. 700 wiki pages!). To make the documentation more accessible, Philip Luppens cobbled up a new documentation [start page](http://wiki.opensymphony.com/display/WW/EasyStartPage). Great work, Phillip!.
