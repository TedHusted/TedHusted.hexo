Since I already post so much to public mailing lists, it's been hard for me to keep up a blog. Anything I want to say, I can say on the list. Meanwhile, out in the field, one thing I hear time and again is that it's hard to keep up with a project's current events.

Out of these two dynamics, "This Week" is born. It's not my intent to create new content here, or at least not much. The intent is to provide a high-level summary of what happens in the projects I follow. Many weeks nothing notable will happen on a project. Other weeks, there will be a clutch of events. I'll also cover what's happening on my own breadwinning projects, mainly to help me see how it all fits together. :)

It's been a busy news week, bloggers. In Apache Struts, we lay the ground work for the [WebWork merger](http://jroller.com/page/TedHusted?entry=merger_debut), contemplate our inner [Checkstyle issues](http://jroller.com/page/TedHusted?entry=checkstyle_woes), discuss [canceling cancel](http://jroller.com/page/TedHusted?entry=cancel_klatch), and even [ship something](http://jroller.com/page/TedHusted?entry=scripting_sails).

In Rollerland, we weight the merits of [Open Document Format](http://jroller.com/page/TedHusted?entry=odf_rocks) and post a second release candidate for [Roller 2.1](http://jroller.com/page/TedHusted?entry=roller_2_1_rc2). On the Husted dot Com homefront, we review the [Agitator](http://jroller.com/page/TedHusted?entry=agitar_software) and unviel the [Struts Mentor](http://jroller.com/page/TedHusted?entry=struts_mentor) site (a work in progress).

##### Next Week

The big item for next week should be an honest-to-gosh Planet Struts website. Since Roller is a Struts application, it only makes sense that we setup an instance devoted to Struts. Planet would be a good place to post Struts-related announcements, along with running serials, like Struts Tips. As a special bonus, I'd like to use the Roller "Planet" tab to links to the blogs of Struts Committers. This could be embarrassing since, right now, most of the committers blog about as often as I do. :)
