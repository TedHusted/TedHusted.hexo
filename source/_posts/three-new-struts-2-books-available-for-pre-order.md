Ian Roughley's mini-book, "Starting with Struts 2", available in print and as a free PDF since May, is about to be joined by three new books about Struts 2.

Coming in October is "Struts 2 Design and Programming: A Tutorial" by Budi Kurniawan. Budi's Struts 1 book is rated "four stars" based on reader reviews at Amazon.

Coming in November is "Practical Apache Struts 2 Web 2.0 Projects" by Ian Roughley, an Apress book. As mentioned, Ian is also the author of "Starting with Struts 2" ([available now!](http://opensource.atlassian.com/confluence/oss/display/BOOKS/ISBN-978-1-4303-2033-3)).

Looking down the road a bit, "Struts 2: The Complete Reference" by James Holmes is scheduled for release in June 2008\. James is also the author of "Struts 1: The Complete Refererence", which may be the most up to date Struts 1 book.
