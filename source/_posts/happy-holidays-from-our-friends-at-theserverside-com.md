Back in October, I was invited to present a couple of talks on Struts at the Ajax Experience in Boston. Now available through TheServerSide.com is the recording from one of the two, "[Struts on Ajax: Retrofitting Struts with Ajax Taglibs".](http://w.on24.com/r.htm?e=98875&amp;s=1&amp;k=1866520B3A2C334E7169D424A04B2F2D)

The slides for both Ajax Experience presentations are also available at [Struts University](http://www.strutsuniversity.org/).

Lately, I placed a couple of other Struts 2 articles with TheServerSide. The first was a general introduction to Struts 2 that is part of the AboutObject Struts and JSF eguide. Coming sometime soon is a second piece about the SmartURLS plugin for Struts 2.0\. (SmartUrls is being merged with the CodeBehind plugin for Struts 2.1). Film at 11 :)

In related news, my second Agitar article finally saw the light of day on the [Sys-Con Media site](http://virtualization.sys-con.com/read/478335.htm). If you are maintaining code that you didn't write, or didn't write recently, Agitar is the quickest way to generate enough tests to "turn fear to boredom".
