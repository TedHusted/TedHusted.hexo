Ted Husted of NimbleUser will be speaking at [ApacheCon in Vancouver BC CA](http://www.blogger.com/www.apachecon.com/) on November 10 and 11 on "The Secret Life of Open Source" and ".NET @ Apache.org".

**The Secret Life of Open Source**

Apache, GNU, Mozilla, Ubuntu, PHP, LibreOffice, Wikipedia -- Today, there are hundreds of open source groups, each with its own culture, methodology, and governance model.

*   How are these groups alike?
*   How are they different?
*   Is there one true path to open source enlightenment, or do many paths converge around a common singularity?
**.NET at Apache.org**

Like it or not, many open source developers are moving to the Microsoft .NET platform, and we're bringing our favorite tools with us! This session looks inside ASF projects that are creating software for .NET and Mono -- like ActiveMQ, Chemistry, Logging, Lucene, QPid, and Thrift -- and show how to create leading-edge ASP.NET applications with ASF open source libraries. We'll also look at integrating other .NET open source projects, like Spring.NET, NVelocity, and JayRock, into your C# application to create a complete open source .NET stack.

Before joining NimbleUser, Ted consulted with teams throughout the United States, including CitiGroup, Nationwide Insurance, and Pepsi Bottling Group, and he is a regular speaker at ApacheCon and the Ajax Experience. Ted is also a former member of the Apache Struts project and co-founder of the Apache (Jakarta) Commons. His books include Google Wave (Preview) Explained, JUnit in Action, Struts in Action, and Professional JSP Site Design.

As a Business Analyst for NimbleUser, Ted concentrates on identifying business needs and crafting solutions that meet an organization's goals, objectives, and budget. Locally, he also serves as VP of Finance for the Rochester Chapter of the International Institute for Business Analysis (IIBA).
