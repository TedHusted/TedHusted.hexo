To make the Struts Action Framework easier for us to maintain, some time ago, we decided to subdivide the original monolithic distribution into seven subprojects. Each subproject was to have its own website, documentation, and release cycle, and could be downloaded separately. I'm happy to say that the initial builds for the svelte seven are now available.

*   [Action](http://svn.apache.org/dist/struts/action/v1.3.0/)
*   [Apps](http://svn.apache.org/dist/struts/apps/v1.3.0/)
*   [EL](http://svn.apache.org/dist/struts/el/v1.3.0/)
*   [Extras](http://svn.apache.org/dist/struts/extras/v1.3.0/)
*   [Taglib](http://svn.apache.org/dist/struts/taglib/v1.3.0/)
*   [Tiles](http://svn.apache.org/dist/struts/tiles/v1.3.0/)
Also available is a "boostrap" distribution of the Struts Action Library, containing the JARs these subproject builds and other related dependencies:

*   [Action Library](http://svn.apache.org/dist/struts/action-lib/action-library_1.3_00.zip%20)
Taken together, these products are the successor to Struts 1.2, so each has started out at version 1.3.0.

I'd like to extend my personal gratitude to James Mitchell and Wendy Smoak, who worked so very hard to revamp the Apache Struts infrastructure, and thereby made these builds possible.
