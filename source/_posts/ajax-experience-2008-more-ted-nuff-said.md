I'll be giving three -- count 'em three -- presentations at the Ajax Experience at the end of September. Two talks are Struts-related reprisals form last year, and the third talk, new this year!, dives into popular tools for testing Ajax applications.

[Hope to see you there!](http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/html/index.html)

### Ajax Testing Tool Review

Not long ago, testing Ajax components meant play-testing a page by hand. Today, there are a growing number of tools we can use to simplify and automate Ajax testing.

In this session we will cover when to test, what to test and how to test Ajax components. You learn how to create automatic tests with various tools, including YUI Test, OpenQA Selenium and TIBCO Test Automation Kit, and how to use Ajax testing tools with IDEs and Continuous Integration systems.

In this session, you will learn:

*   When, where and how to test Ajax components;
*   How to create automatic tests with various tools;
*   How to use Ajax testing tools with IDEs and Continuous Integration systems.

### Struts on Ajax: Retrofitting Struts with Ajax Taglibs

Struts is Java's most popular web framework. Ajax is the web's hottest user interface. What happens when we put Struts on Ajax?

In this session, we stir some Ajax wizardry into a conventional Struts application, without all the sweat and bother of writing our own JavaScript. Struts 1 and Struts 2 both support Ajax taglibs that look and feel just like ordinary JSP tags. If it's just a little bit of Ajax that you want, these tags will get you around the learning curve in record time.

During the session, we will cover

*   Using the Java Web Parts taglib with Struts 1
*   Using the Ajax YUI plugin with Struts 2
Who should attend: Struts developers who would like to utilize Ajax with existing applications, and Ajax developers who would like to utilize Struts as a backend.

To get the most from this session, some familiarity with Struts or a similar framework is helpful.

### Ajax on Struts: Coding an Ajax Application with Struts 2

Ajax is the web's hottest user interface. Struts is Java's most popular web framework. What happens when we put Ajax on Struts?

In this session, , we look at writing a new Struts 2 application from square one, using the Yahoo User Interface (YUI) Library on the front end, and Struts 2 on the backend. YUI provides the glitz and the glamour, and Struts 2 provides the dreary business logic, input validation, and text formatting.

During the session, we will cover

*   How to integrate an Ajax UI with Struts 2
*   Basics of the Yahoo User Interface (YUI) Library
*   Business services Struts can provide to an Ajax UI
Who should attend: Ajax developers who would like to utilize Struts as a back-end, and Struts developers who would like to utilize Ajax as a front-end.

To get the most from this session, some familiarity with an Ajax library, like YUI or Dojo, is helpful.
