<span style="font-size:180%;">Merger Debut</span>

Our [draft proposal](http://www.mail-archive.com/dev%40struts.apache.org/msg17428.html) for bringing WebWork into Apache Struts via the Incubator has passed the muster on the Struts Dev list. Next, we need to do the same on the Incubator General list. Once that second hurdle is passed, we can bring the code into the Incubator repository and have at it.
