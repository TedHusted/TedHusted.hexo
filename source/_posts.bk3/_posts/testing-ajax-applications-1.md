On October 7, about two dozen RIT Computer Science students came for Salvatore's famous Buffalo Wing Pizza, but stayed for the scintillating tales of Ajax testing derring do.
<div>[![](https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/b5d49-rit-csc.jpg)](http://csc.masterpi.org/)Of those present only a few had Ajax experience. (Not surprising, since Ajax is not part of the formal curriculium!) Happily, Ajax 101 was included in the talk (just for that eventuality). The presentation is available through [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/ted.husted). The presentation covers several of my favorite testing tools, including:</div>

*   Selenium - [http://selenium.openqa.org/](http://selenium.openqa.org/)
*   Hudson - [https://hudson.dev.java.net/](https://hudson.dev.java.net/)
*   Tomcat - [http://tomcat.apache.org/](http://tomcat.apache.org/)
*   YUI Test - [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuitest/](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuitest/)
<div>The [lively crowd](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ2R-03clK4) raised a number of good questions, including:</div>

*   Is YUI Unit better than JsUnit?
*   Does social networking require Ajax?
*   Are shoes required at VanDamme Associates?
<div>Answers: _Yes, No, Sometimes_</div>
