<span style="font-size:180%;">Ready to Give Back? Help Sponsor ApacheCon!</span>

[Sponsorships for ApacheCon Europe 2007 are still available!](http://www.eu.apachecon.com/sponsors/)

The conference opens May 1 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, so time is short, but if your organization might be able to help, please contact Delia Frees at delia@apachecon.com or on +1 707 765 0823\. Various sponsorship levels and other custom strategies are available. Our willingness to work with people does extend to convention sponsorship!

ApacheCon Europe 2007 is the official conference of the Apache Software Foundation  (ASF). ApacheCon draws ASF Members, innovators,  programmers, developers, vendors, and users to experience the future of Open Source development. Meet, mingle, and exchange ideas with like-minded participants on groundbreaking technologies and emerging industry trends, through informal networking, peer discussions, birds-of-a-feather sessions, and entertaining social events.

In related news, the US conference will be held in Atlanta GA, November 12-16, 2007\. For Atlanta, I'm hoping to snag one of the whole-day training sessions or maybe an "Ajax Smackdown" presention, and then do that meet and mingle thing :)
