[Apache HTTPD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_httpd) has been the Internet's most popular web server since 1996, and the worldwide [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/) conferences are well known for providing hardcore technical data around Apache HTTPD and some of the other fifty-odd ASF projects. Along with the usual bits and bytes, [ApacheCon NA 2010](http://na.apachecon.com/c/acna2010/schedule/grid) (Nov 1-5, Atlanta GA) is broadening its scope with Content Technology, Business, and Community tracks. Other tracks Tomcat, Lucene, NoSQL, Tuscany, OSGi, Enterprise Java, Commons, Mahout, and Hadoop, and, of course, HTTPD.

I'll be presenting an updated version of my [Open Source Secret Sauce presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/ted.husted) on Thu, Nov 4, 2010, at 4p, as part of the Community track. OSSS discusses how volunteer open-source projects create and maintain so many compelling, competitive products, and asks "What is the Open Source Secret Sauce?"

The presentation covers

*   Why open source matters,
*   How open source development works at the ASF, and
*   What makes open source projects successful.
If you caught the OSSS presentation at BlueTie or [FOSSCon 2010](http://fosscon.org/), and have any suggestions, drop me a line.

This will be my fifth ApacheCon, and I'm looking forward to another whirlwind of war stories, brain dumps, and social goodness.
