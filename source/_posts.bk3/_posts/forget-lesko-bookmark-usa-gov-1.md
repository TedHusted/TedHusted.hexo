If you have a hankering for quick access to US government services, surf on by [usa.gov](http://www.usa.gov/ "usa.gov"). Originally, FirstGov.gov, the nation's portal has evolved from a special project to a regular appropriation of the US Congress. Positioned as the US government's answer to Google, the mission of [usa.gov](http://www.usa.gov/ "usa.gov") is to help find existing resources. Other US government sites create content, and [usa.gov](http://www.usa.gov/ "usa.gov") exposes it.

[![](https://tedhusted.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/dbb3d-usa-gov.jpg)](http://usa.gov/)Ironically, a great way that [usa.gov](http://usa.gov/ "usa.gov") exposes content is by creating it. The site features a daily blog called "[Gov Gab](http://blog.usa.gov/roller/govgab/ "Gov Gab") " that is the handiwork of a handful of federal employees who work the Office of Citizen Services and Communications at the U.S. General Services Administration. The blogs mix a health dose of links with personal and professional anecdotes.

For those of us who surf to edit, other sites of note include the [FTC's Computers and The Internet section](http://ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/tech.shtm "FTC") and the [Usabilty.gov](http://usabilty.gov/ "Usabilty.gov") site. The former hosts vital advice on Internet security and privacy, and the later catalogs essential tips on creating easy to use sites.
