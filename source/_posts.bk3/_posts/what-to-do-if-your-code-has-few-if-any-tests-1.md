*   What to Do if Your Code Has Few, If Any Tests?
*   Agitar Webinar with Ted Husted
*   7 a.m. and 5 p.m. PST on Wednesday 26 April
Everyone has worked on a code base that seems to work, but has almost no test assets. Maybe you?ve had some system-level tests or functional demos that provide a quick ?health check.? But you have nothing to validate functionality or test the corner cases. As a developer in this situation, you?re flying blind. That goes double if your code is a framework or application componentry.

Ted Husted, member of the Apache Struts development team, had exactly this problem with the open source Struts framework. He?ll be presenting a webinar on his experiences with using Agitar to investigate the Struts 1.2 code base and automatically create a series of unit tests. The presentation will provide an overview of what a typical developer would experience, how they need to think about exploratory unit testing, and how to make the most quality progress with a body of code that has few if any tests.

Registration for the 7 a.m. PST webinar, or the 5 p.m. PST one, is required.

**NOTE:** Unlike Struts, the Agitator is **not** a free open source tool. The Agitator is intended for large-scale Java projects who would like to implement an automated developer testing program.
