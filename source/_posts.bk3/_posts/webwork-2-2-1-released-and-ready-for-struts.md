The WebWork team announced a milestone release in the WebWork 2.2 series on Feburary 4\. For details, see the [WebWork announcement](http://blogs.opensymphony.com/webwork/2006/02/webwork_221_released.html). A companion release of [XWork 1.1](http://forums.opensymphony.com/thread.jspa?threadID=16919&amp;tstart=0) is also available.

Meanwhile, we have filed our merger proposal with the Apache Incubator PMC. The next step is to finish collecting [Contributor License Agreements](http://apache.org/licenses/), and then we can bring the WebWork 2.x codebase into the incubator.
