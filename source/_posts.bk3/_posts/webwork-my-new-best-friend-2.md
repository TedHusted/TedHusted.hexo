Although still under development, the [Struts Mentor site](http://www.strutsmentor.com/) is already hard at work (Praise Google!), and I now have a WebWork training course scheduled for May. Although, we're just getting started on the OK DEQ stuff again, I've blocked out this week to work on a Struts MailReader for WebWork, along with some other new documentation. Duty now for the future!
