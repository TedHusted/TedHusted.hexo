People often mention "Apache Rules". We don't actually have a rule book, but if we did, here's what I believe might be the top thirteen practices.
<table border="1" cellpadding="8">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>0</th>
<td>Projects must be managed in a collaborative, meritocratic way, so that new volunteers are encouraged to join the project group, and so that the volunteers doing the work are the volunteers who make the decisions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>1</th>
<td>A project's primary web site and mailing lists must be maintained on ASF hardware. Resources maintained elsewhere are not ASF resources, even if maintained by ASF committers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>2</th>
<td>Code and documentation donated to the ASF must be maintained on ASF hardware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>3</th>
<td>Project source code and documentation must be donated to the ASF under a [Contributor's License Agreement](http://apache.org/licenses/index.html#clas).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>4</th>
<td>Donated source code and documentation must carry the ASF copyright and be placed under the Apache License.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>5</th>
<td>Other libraries included with a distribution must be redistributable under the Apache license.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>6</th>
<td>PMC members can veto a product change with a technical justification.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>7</th>
<td>An ASF release must be approved by at least three members of the PMC. A release cannot be vetoed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>8</th>
<td>Releases must be digitally signed by a release manager.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>9</th>
<td>The PMC chair/Project VP must submit a status report to the ASF board every three months</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>A</th>
<td>PMC members are encouraged to nominate qualified contributors as new committers. ASF Members are encouraged to nominate qualified committers as new members.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>B</th>
<td>Obtaining a non-exclusive ASF copyright on all material in the ASF repository is encouraged.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>C</th>
<td>[Author tags](http://tinyurl.com/mw7t6) in source code are discouraged but permitted.</td>
</tr>

Of course, there are other customs, but I believe that most other ASF practices would stem from this initial set. And, as with all things ASF, YMMV! :)
