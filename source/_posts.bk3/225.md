<span style="font-size:180%;">Action2 Cookbook is off the backburner</span>

I finally got a start a merging the Struts Action and WebWork 2.2 example applications. For Action 2, we might end up with something like

*   Blank

*   Cookbook or Showcase

*   Portlet

*   MailReader

*   ShoppingCartI checked in preliminary alpha versions of the Blank2 and Cookbook2 to the Apache Struts sandbox yesterday. Ultimately, the Cookbook would incorporate the [use cases](http://www.blogger.com/%20http://opensource2.atlassian.com/confluence/oss/display/STRUTS/Application+Use+Cases) in the WebWork ShowCase, the original Struts Examples, along with the new Struts Cookbook.

*   [Showcase](http://strutsmentor.com/showcase/)

*   [Examples](http://strutsmentor.com/struts-examples/)

*   [Cookbook](http://strutsmentor.com/struts-cookbook/)Once a working version of the Action2 Cookbook is up and running, a WebWork MailReader would be next. While building a new MailReader, I'd be sure to add generic versions of the use cases to the new Action2 Cookbook.
