<span style="font-size:180%;">Where the source?</span>
<pre>&gt; Is the source code download from
&gt; Struts in Action still available?
</pre>

At that very, very bottom of the [Manning page](http://manning.com/husted/), there's a link to the companion [source download to the book](http://www.manning-source.com/books/husted/husted_src.zip). The download is also available at the [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=49385), and  Struts sandbox code for Scaffold is now available in the ["archive" branch](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/struts/archive/struts-sandbox/scaffold/). 

Though, for the data access portions of Scaffold, I'd strongly recommend using [Apache iBATIS](http://ibatis.apache.org/) instead.

Of course, if you have some latitude as to what version of Struts to use, do take a look at [Struts 2](http://struts.apache.org/) :)

Except for "WebWork in Action", I don't believe there are any S2 books quite yet, but the materials from my S2 training course are [available online](http://code.google.com/p/sq1-struts2/).
