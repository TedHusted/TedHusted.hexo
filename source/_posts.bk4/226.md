<span style="font-size:180%;">Planet Struts Countdown</span>

In keeping with the [ "Embarrassment of Riches"](http://opensource2.atlassian.com/confluence/oss/download/attachments/829/struts-2006-3.pdf) theme, I'm pleased to announce the **Planet Struts** blog site. Planet Struts aggegates announcements about Struts and Struts-related products, along with Committer blogs. To prime the pump, we back loaded a few months' worth of announcements.

*   [http://www.PlanetStruts.org/roller/](http://www.planetstruts.org/roller/)Meanwhile, there were three Struts Resource directories in existance, but none of these were complete or up to date. With Shale and WebWork/Action 2 in play, it seemed like time for a new directory that covered all the Struts products, and also strove to be comprehensive. Enter Struts Central:

*   ["http://www.StrutsCentral.net/](http://www.strutscentral.net/)Struts Central is designed to complement Planet Struts. New resources can be announced on Planet Struts and the link summarized and archived on Struts Central.

The official launch date for these sites is March 1, but I thought my blog-watchers deserved a sneak-peak. _Enjoy!_
