The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), makers of Apache HTTPD, Apache Solr, and more than fifty other open source products, will today post its one millionth update to the Subversion software repository shared by all its products. [Apache Subversion](http://subversion.apache.org/) is a leading open source SCM repository, available for both Windows and Linux platforms.

Software projects use repositories to provide for version control and group communications. Whenever a developer makes a change to a local copy of the software source code, he or she "commits" the change to the repository when its is ready to be shared with the group. Developers can also "roll back" a change if a problem is found later.

The ASF provides technical and legal infrastructure for Subversion, Apache HTTPD, and other open source products who have adopted the [ASF's meritocratic development model](http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html).

Apache HTTPD has been the number one web server on the Internet since April 1996\. Apache is also the "A" in the popular [LAMP stack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29) that powers other products, like the Drupal content management system.

The annual ASF convention, ApacheCon, is being held Nov 1-5 in Atlanta GA. Join me there for my talk on [The Open Source Secret Sauce](http://na.apachecon.com/c/acna2010/sessions/561).
