<span style="font-size:180%;">Planet Struts Counts Down</span>

The PlanetStruts.org domain is registered, but a minor technical glitch kept me from launching it yet. Same old, same old. The host has the wrong JAR in a priviledged, shared directory which is confounding the database. But, as soon as JAR hell is sorted out, all systems are go! 

Planet Struts will be powered by Apache Roller. Using the Roller "Planet" feature, we can use it to aggregate the blogs of Struts Committers. The site can also host a "Newswire" blog to post announcements about Struts. Most of these will be taken from the Struts User list. I have about ten months worth of announcements to post to Planet Struts as part of the initial launch, just so people can see where the site is going.

To complement Planet Struts, I've been combining and updating various Struts resource directories into a new site "Struts Central". It's still under construction, but [a working prototype](http://www.strutsmentor.com/Resources/index.html) is available through the Struts Mentor site (also still a prototype).

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Next week</span>

With Planet Struts and Struts Central counting down, I can refocus on the Struts 1.3.x release. We've been discussing how to resolve the checkstyle issues on dev@struts, and we seem close to consensus now.
