<span style="font-size:180%;">Struts from Square One: Part 1, Text Complete</span>

There's still the last mile to go, but at least the text for part one has reached its first full draft. Now, it's down to fussing with the figures. :)

From the [GoogleCode site](http://code.google.com/p/sq1-struts2/):
> Apache Struts 2 from Square One is a training course designed for people who want to create Java web applications, not just quickly, but correctly. Training sessions include a technology primer and a coding exercise. This Project hosts materials used by the course including slide presentations, coding exercises, and a companion text book. The course can be used for independant study or in a classroom setting.

[As mentioned](http://jroller.com/page/TedHusted?entry=googlecode), the course is something I developed over the years for Struts 1, and then adapted for WebWork 2, and now for Struts 2\. The course itself is the usual "slides and labs" affair. 

Struts 2 from Square One is a textbook adaptation of the course. I'd like to print the text through [LuLu.com](http://lulu.com/) and include it as part of the course. If people want to use the textbook for individual homestudy, that's fine too. Eventually, what I started at the [Struts University](http://www.strutsuniversity.org/) site will be migrated to the Square One GoogleCode site.

With Struts 2 in GA mode, I'll have a bit more time to work on this, but there's no telling how long it will take to finish the other three parts. To an extent, how much effort I can put into the text depends on whether people engage me to [present the course](http://www.strutsmentor.com/) this year. 

In the meantime, [an early release of the manuscript is available as a PDF](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=49385&amp;package_id=223769&amp;release_id=490486). Enjoy!
