<span style="font-size:180%;">Struts Mentor</span>

The first prototype of the [Struts Mentor](http://www.strutsmentor.com/) site is up. There's 400+ hours left on the Oklahoma contract, but once we wrap that up, I'd like to focus on training. The twist is that the Struts Mentor training materials will be open source too: "Open source courseware for an open source framework." Hopefully, other people will teach from the materials too, so that the courseware will benefit more people that anyone of us could reach on our own.

Over at [Struts University](http://strutsuniversity.org/), I dabbled a bit with a MailReader Training Course for Action 1, but I think the better place to start would be Action 2 (WebWork) or Shale.
