Another great technology resource for non-profits is Idealware ([www.idealware.org](http://www.idealware.org/)). The site provides "thoroughly researched, impartial and accessible resources about software to help nonprofits make smart software decisions."

There are a number of Idealware reports available, including the [Field guide to Software for Nonprofits](http://www.idealware.org/homepage-features/field-guide-feature2), and most recently, the[ Nonprofit Social Media Decision Guide](http://www.idealware.org/reports/nonprofit-social-media-decision-guide).

The Decision Guide is an exquisite 70-page whitepaper crammed with practical advice that any nonprofit can put to work today. The guide covers Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, Photo Sharing, Video Sharing, and additional social media channels.

The material is based directly on original research conducted by Idealware. For each media, Idealware provides solid guidelines on getting the most for your time and effort.

The guide also highlights interesting and entertaining comments taken from the survey. And Idealware is not shy about providing their own analysis, such as "As a rule of thumb, set aside at least two hours each week for each social media channel."

If you're wondering whether to focus on Twitter or Blogs, or Facebook versus Flickr, this [whitepaper ](http://www.idealware.org/reports/nonprofit-social-media-decision-guide)is for you.

My only raised eyebrow is that the guide marginalized LinkedIn. My viewpoint may be skewed from involvement in professional organizations, but LinkedIn and LinkedIn forums are my preferred social networks.

According to the guide, for most nonprofits, a Facebook page will yield the best bang for the buck, if you have the time to maintain it, but the key is to integrate your communication strategy into a "cohesive whole". For details, see the guide :)

I do have to say that the writing is simply excellent. Everything about the guide screams quality and attention to detail. If you only read one Social Media resource this year, let it be [Idealware's Decision Guide](http://www.idealware.org/reports/nonprofit-social-media-decision-guide).
