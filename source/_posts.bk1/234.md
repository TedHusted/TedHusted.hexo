<span style="font-size:180%;">iBATIS 1-2-3</span>

According to[ a post on iBATIS dev@](http://www.mail-archive.com/dev%40ibatis.apache.org/msg00945.html), "Lotus would like to use iBatis for Java's data mapper capabilities in a future release of an IBM / Lotus collaboration product."

If so, we might see a rising number of iBATIS articles published by DeveloperWorks. As of today, there's four

##### Ready, Set, ...
Meanwhile, rumour has it that **iBATIS in Action** is now manuscript-complete and in the final stages of peer review. (OK, it's more than a rumour, I'm one of the peers!)

IIA was a year in the making by none other than Clinton Begin, Brandon Goodin, and Larry Meadors. The book is not available for pre-order yet, but look for it soon. The book is mostly Java focused, but Chapter 1 and Appendix A include some .NET topics. So, there's yet something for Gilles, Roberto, and Ron to do :)
