<span style="font-size:180%;">ApacheCon US 2007 CFP Submissions</span>

I submitted my [ApacheCon 2007 US](http://www.us.apachecon.com/) proposals in this morning. I often submit multiple proposals, but I've never had more than one accepted at a time.

_Migrating to Ajax_ - Leverage your hard-earned web development experience and learn how to migrate old-school web applications to Ajax and RPC. This full-day training session covers "Model 2" applications based on frameworks like Struts, as well as "Model 1" applications based on PHP or JSP. Prior Ajax experience is not required.

_ Ajax Petstore Smackdown_ - Let's compare conventional implementations of Petstore using Struts or Tapestry with Web 2.0 implementions using Ajax and RPC. Which is better, faster, cheaper ... or just more fun to write!

_.NET @ Apache.org_ - Like it or not, many open source developers are moving to the Microsoft .NET platform, and we're bringing our favorite tools with us! In this session, we look inside ASF projects that are creating software for .NET and Mono ... iBATIS, Logging, and Lucene ... and show how to create leading-edge ASP.NET applications with open source libraries.

Whether one of these are accepted or not, I expect I'll wander down to Atlanta this November. It's one of the few places where I can get a direct flight!
