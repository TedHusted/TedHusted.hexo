<span style="font-size:180%;">Why do we call it Apache?</span>

Digging into the email archives we find ....

(If you're wondering about the name, say "Apache server" ten times fast. Europeans may want to fake their best American accent while trying this).

As for comments about offending native americans, I see the choice of 'apache' being made out of respect for the efficiency and robustness of these native tribes.

As with many things historic, there seem to be two reasons. Because it sounds like "a patchy"  (server) <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">and</span> as a tribute to the native Apache tribes.

I'm surprised no one mentioned the [helicopter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AH-64_Apache)! :)
